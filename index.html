  <p><u>The Eight Queens Problem<u><p>
  <p>The problem originated in 1848 when German chess composer Max Bezzel published the puzzle.
  The challenge was to arrange 8 Queens on an 8x8 chessboard in an arrangement where they wouldnâ€™t be able to attack each other.<p> 
  <p>The very first solutions were published in 1850 by mathematician Franz Nauck. 
  Soon after, more solutions were found, totalling to 92.<p>
  <p>Nauck also wondered if the same principle applied for any number of Queens on a chessboard of the same dimensions as the number of Queens desired.
  And thus, the N Queens Problem was born (with N being the number of Queens and dimensions of the board).<p>
  <p>In the years since its creation, many famous mathematicians have worked on the puzzle, including Carl Gauss.

  <p>This handy little animation will visually show how this problem is solved using computer algorithms.<p>
  <p><u>Backtracking<u><p>
  <p>The Backtracking Algorithm is what checks if there are available spaces in a row and column in the N-Queen's Problem.<p>
  <p>If there is an available location the program marks the row and column as a part of the solution, it will continue until it can return True.<p>
  <p>If the algorithm does not find an available location on the row it will backtrack and return False.<p>
