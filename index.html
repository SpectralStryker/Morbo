  <u>The Eight Queens Problem<u>
  The problem originated in 1848 when German chess composer Max Bezzel published the puzzle.
  The challenge was to arrange 8 Queens on an 8x8 chessboard in an arrangement where they wouldnâ€™t be able to attack each other. 
  The very first solutions were published in 1850 by mathematician Franz Nauck. 
  Soon after, more solutions were found, totalling to 92.
  Nauck also wondered if the same principle applied for any number of Queens on a chessboard of the same dimensions as the number of Queens desired.
  And thus, the N Queens Problem was born (with N being the number of Queens and dimensions of the board). 
  In the years since its creation, many famous mathematicians have worked on the puzzle, including Carl Gauss.

  <u>Backtracking<u>
  The Backtracking Algorithm is what checks if there are available spaces in a row and column in the N-Queen's Problem. 
  If there is an available location the program marks the row and column as a part of the solution, it will continue until it can return True. 
  If the algorithm does not find an available location on the row it will backtrack and return False.
